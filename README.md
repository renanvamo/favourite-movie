# My Favourite Movie List

A website developed to create a list of movies to watch, so the user can stop wasting time searching for movies in apps.

## My First Project

This website was created to improve my skills in React and API application.
* [x] Create a repository
* [x] Push all files from my directory to this repository
* [x] Create a README file
* [x] Create the React files and directories
* [x] Create components 
* [x] Test the API 
* [ ] 

Until my application isn't finished, I will work on the README file.
